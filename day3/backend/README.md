### Step by Step

1. Creating a new Node.js project
    1. Run `npm init` to create a new package.json file in the current directory.
    2. Add some dummy console.log code in a file `index.js` in the current directory.
    3. Add a new script `"start": "node index.js",` in the `package.json` file.
    4. Run `npm start` to run the dummy code.

2. Add express. Refer to the [official documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for more details.
    1. Run `npm install express` to install express.
    2. Add the sample backend code in the `index.js` file.
    3. Set `"type": "module",` in the `package.json` file to use ES6 import/export syntax.
    4. Run `npm start` to run the express server.
